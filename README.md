# GOAL-CR
This project is concerned with computing access policies that minimize the expected contention resolution time in single random access networks. The uncertainty in the contention is addressed by modeling the problem as a partially observable Markov decision process. A greedy algorithm was developed to solve the POMDP in polynomial time.
